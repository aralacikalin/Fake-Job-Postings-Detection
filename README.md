Project for the course NLP in University of Tartu

Goal of this project is to classifiy the fake job posts from a highly unbalanced data.

With the results of data expoloration we removed the fields that has more tha 60% missing values. We have cleaned the non-ascii characters.

In the end with our way of cleaning the data, feature engineering and modifying the machine learning model we were able to get decent results.
